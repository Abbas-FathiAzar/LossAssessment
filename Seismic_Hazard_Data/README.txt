This folder contains data of seismic hazard curves.

The first column is period (second) and the second column is spectral acceleration in g.

"SeismicHazardData_0.524sec.txt" contains seismic hazard curve data for non-isolated building with SCBF.
"SeismicHazardData_2.990sec.txt" contains seismic hazard curve data for non-isolated building with SMF.
"SeismicHazardData_3.660sec.txt" contains seismic hazard curve data for isolated building (lower bound isolator properties).
