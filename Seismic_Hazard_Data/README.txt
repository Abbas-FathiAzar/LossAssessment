This folder contains data of seismic hazard curves.

The first column is spectral acceleration (in the unit of "g") and the second column is the mean annual frequency of exceedance.

"SeismicHazardData_0.524sec.txt" contains seismic hazard curve data for non-isolated building with SCBF.
"SeismicHazardData_2.990sec.txt" contains seismic hazard curve data for non-isolated building with SMF.
"SeismicHazardData_3.660sec.txt" contains seismic hazard curve data for isolated building (lower bound isolator properties).
